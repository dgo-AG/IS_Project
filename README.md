# IS Dataset Project
__This is a dataset analysis project for programming 1.__

This analysis delves into the future of jobs in the age of artificial intelligence. It exemplifies how various professions, skills, and education levels might be impacted by AI-driven automation by the year 2030. The dataset analyzed comes from professional researchers on Kaggle that study the job market and career trends bieng impacted by AI. It covers various variables like different types of jobs and their risk level including the kind of technology use and AI exposure rates that are involved. This information was further understood through the process of answering different questions and relating them to how and why they're relevant in the current job market. We achieved this through applying matplotlib and pandas in our code to create graphs that would gather information from the dataset and exemplify the answers of said questions. These questions included...

-*1:* What is the average probability for all jobs to be automated by AI?

-*2:* Is there a correlation between the education level required for a job and its probability to be automated by 2030?

-*3:* Is there a connection to a jobs risk and its potential to be automated by 2030? 

-*4:* Is there a correlation between a jobs growth in use of tech and its overall exposure rate to AI?

-*5:* What proportion of jobs offer high salaries and require advanced AI skills?

-*6:* Which skills drive higher salaries and are most valuable for career growth?

-*7:* How many jobs require strong AI skills and have high demand?

-*8:* Which AI skill and education combinations correspond to the highest-paying jobs?

Through our analysis we found that the scope of how AI is used will continue to develop and further lean towards AI automation for work. This was found to be especially true for more dangerous jobs that rely heavily on people which range from being physically and mentally strenuous as well. Along with information such as job types and their use rate of tech and AI exposure, the datasetanalysis helps us better understand which careers will evolve exponentially. In all, it allows for valuable insight into how technology willl shape the workforce in the near future.
